  Per the National Center for Charitable Statistics, nonprofits in the United States spend close to $1 trillion annually. The nature of spending money to provide a social good “Investment” within their surrounding community is a unique factor that differentiates nonprofit spending from other forms of common individual or business spending. A nation’s Real Gross Domestic Product (GDP adjusted for inflation) is most directly related to Consumer Spending, Investment Spending, Government Spending, and Net Exports. Nonprofit Spending is a gray area that pertains to both areas of Consumer and Investment Spending. It is related to the latter due to their missions to serve the community - often striving to make the world more beneficial by reducing barriers to entry, and increasing research and development, which eventually increases Labor productivity. Prior research completed in this field of study focuses on the effects of aggregate Nonprofit Spending.
  This study looks at a new branch of prior research by investigating not only the general effects of nonprofit spending, but also the differences between that and a subsection of Nonprofits, and how they compare with the United States’ Unemployment Rate. The Data used in this research is from 2005 - 2019, covering the pre and post-recessionary eras of the United States Economy.
